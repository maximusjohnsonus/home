Caps lock is shift, left control is Caps Lock,
and altGr and right control are swapped.

In /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/pc:
edit key <CAPS> and key <LCTL>.

In /usr/share/X11/xkb/keycodes/evdev:
swap the keycode values for RCTL and RALT.

Run
setxkbmap -layout us
to update the values changed in pc (you may have to delete a file - google it).
Restart (maybe just log out/in) to update evdev values
